## Activity_2

In the session 3, we learned about **version control and GitHub**. Version control allows you to keep track of your work and helps you to easily explore the changes you have made, be it data, coding scripts, notes, etc. This approach will leave you with tens or hundreds of similar files, making it rather cumbersome to directly compare different versions, and is not easy to share among collaborators. With version control software such as Git, version control is much smoother and easier to implement. Using an online platform like GitHub to store your files means that you have an online back-up of your work, which is beneficial for both you and your collaborators. At the end of this session, for further practice, we should do the following activity:

1.	Create a new repository and name it *"My First Repository"*

2.	Create a *README.md file for the repository*

3.	Clone the repository to your local system

4.	Use R Studio to *edit the README.md file*; use markdown syntax to introduce yourself and your repository

5.	Copy the R Markdown note that you created in Activity 1 to your local repository

6.	Use GitHub Desktop to track your changes locally, to commit them, and to push them to the GitHub repository

7.	Once you have done this, email the link to your repository to both instructors.
