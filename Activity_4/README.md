# Activity_4

In this activity, we should **Create documentation for our project data** using the requirements for the [*Elsevier Data in Brief submissions*](https://www.elsevier.com/journals/data-in-brief/2352-3409/guide-for-authors) as a guide. 

**Data in Brief** only publishes Data in Brief data articles that describe research data you've made publicly available either through a repository or directly in your Data in Brief article. Data articles support original research. They improve research integrity and reproducibility by making the data available and discoverable and reduce unwanted duplication of research.  Indeed, there is a [template](https://www.elsevier.com/__data/promis_misc/DIB%20Article%20Template%203.2.1.docx) file that you need to complete according to the article that is being processed.
