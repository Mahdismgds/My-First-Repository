## Activity_1

In this session we are introduced to the text editor called **R Markdown** that 
allows us to work with a simple text file that can be rendered in different ways, for instance html, pdf, and Word. Markdown offers simple formatting options, and lacks the extensive functionality of word processors, such as Microsoft Word and Word Perfect. On the other hand, Markdown files can be created and edited in free text editors. Finally, our first activity includes the following:

1.	Create a new R Markdown file, name it *"Your Name Activity 1"*

2.	Create a level-1 header and write in less than 200 words what is your *main research interest*. Use formatting for emphasis as appropriate.

3.	Create a new level-1 header and type *"Favorites"*.

4.	Under this header, create a level-2 header *"Favorite Music"*. Create a numbered list with your 5 favorite songs.

5.	Still under favorites, create a new level-2 header *"Favorite Equation"* and type your favorite equation

6.	Still under favoritism create a new level-2 header *"Favorite Artists"* and create a table with two columns "Name" and "Achievements". Populate the table with 5 favorite artists.

7.	Create a new level-1 header and type *"A Chunk of Code"*. Under this header create a chunk of code, whatever you want R to do immediately for you.

8.	Once you have done this, knit your document to PDF and email to both instructors.
