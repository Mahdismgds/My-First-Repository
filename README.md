# My-First-Repository

I am a Ph.D. student at *McMaster University*. This is the first repository I have built for the course of [**Reproducible Research Workflow with GitHub and R**](https://github.com/paezha/Reproducible-Research-Workflow). This course consists of *12 sessions*, and at the end of each session there is an activity that is placed in this repository and is as follows:

* Activity 1: Create R markdown file and explain about your main research interest, favorite music, favorite equation, and favorite artists.

* Activity 2: Create a new repository and name it "My First Repository" and then Copy the R Markdown note that you created in Activity 1 to your local repository.

* Activity 3: List the data that you expect to use, collect or create in your project. And then go through the Quick Hits for Data Management and identify possible strategies to build and protect the value of your data.

* Activity 4: Create documentation for your project data using the requirements for the Elsevier Data in Brief submissions as a guide.

* Activity 5: Complete the Data in Brief activity - place in ReadMe file to make it accessible by others to review.
