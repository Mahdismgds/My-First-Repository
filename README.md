# My-First-Repository

 I am Mahdis Moghadasi and New PhD student at McMaster University. This is my first repository I have built for Activity 2.
 

# Main Research Interest

  My main research interests are landuse changes and environmental planning, accessibility, Transportation planning and Machine Learning.
  
  During my Master education, my supervisor and I have published [two articles](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mahdis-Moghadasi) on how land use changes during 1996-2016 in one of Iran's metropolitan areas and I also researched about the potential accessibility of the transportation network in Iran in my master's thesis. Since I was faced with a large amount of data so I decided to learn machine learning and data analysis.
 
  In addition, I will also be researching mobility justice in my PhD, which is of great interest to me both in terms of data analysis and in terms of subject matter. Because I think the achievements of this study will have a tremendous impact on the lives of citizens and It will also have great scientific achievements for me as a PhD student.
